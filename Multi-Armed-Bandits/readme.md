# Multi-Armed bandits(Immediate RL problems)
Multi-armed bandits are ignored by a lot of people who begin studying RL,but I think that it is the best place to gain a strong mathematical foothold and get an idea of how things would work in a RL problem.

### Hello world of Reinforcement learning.

I would strongly advice you guys to go through the resources I am going to list down.These will be enough for theoretically studying bandits.
1. [Getting to know the problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit)  
Just go through the introduction from wikipedia.
2. [Proffesor Balaraman Ravindran's RL week 1 and week 2](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106143/)  
As you are watching the lectures it is a must that you code the algorithms as you learn them.
I have implemented the following algorithms in agents.py
- [X] epsilon-greedy
- [x] softmax
- [x] UCB1
- [x] Median elimination
- [ ] Other variants of UCB
- [ ] Thompson sampling
- [ ] Policy gradient methods

#The ones which I havent implemented(You could/should if you want to).

After you are done with this I would recommend to go through the notes that I made in the following order.These notes are short and summarize the topics in a really brief manner.I would suggest you to make similar notes
