# Monte-Carlo model free methods
Monte-Carlo is the start of model free learning algorithms.
1. [CS234 Lecture 3(Leave the TD-learning half for now)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRIhrn8cc9w&list=PLoROMvodv4rOSOPzutgyCTapiGlY2Nd8u&index=3)
2. [Professor Balaraman Ravindran's RL until week 6 second lecture](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106143/)
3. [Sutton and Barton chapter 5](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)

You could also checkout the David silver lecture series, although I found CS234 much better.

I have used the [blackjack environment](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/toy_text/blackjack.py) of OpenAi gym
to implement the following algorithms

- [ ] On policy Monte-Carlo(With exploring start)
- [ ] On policy Monte-Carlo(without exploring start)
- [x] Off policy Monte-Carlo
