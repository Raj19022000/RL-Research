# Classical reinforcement learning
After a year of exploring the field as a beginner, I think I have approximated a near optimal policy of how to start learning Reinforcement learning for a begginer from a researchers point of view.This repository is to share my RL journey and resources so that you can get an insight on how to learn how to learn.

this repo has:

- [x] Python implementations of various topics in sequential order.
- [x] Free Resources that I found to be helpful(Video lecture links, online articles and blogs).

Please feel free to open up a PR if you think you have more sources or notes to share :)
