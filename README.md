# Classical reinforcement learning
After a year of exploring the field as a beginner, I found a good policy of how to start learning Reinforcement learning for a begginer from a researchers point of view. This repository is to share my RL journey and resources so that you can get an insight on how to learn how to learn.

this repo has:

- [x] Python implementations of various topics in sequential order.
- [x] Free Resources that I found to be helpful(Video lecture links, online articles and blogs).

Please feel free to open up a PR if you think you have more sources or notes to share :)

Note:

The python implementations of algorithms are not optimized and are meant to be for learning purposes only.
