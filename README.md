# RL-research
After a year of exploring the field as a beginner, I think I have approximated a near optimal policy of how to start learning Reinforcement learning for a begginer from a researchers point of view.This repository is to share my RL journey and resources so that you can get an insight on how to learn how to learn.

I have included:

- [x] Detailed instructions about how to understand and learn the topics sequentially.
- [x] Free Resources that I found to be helpful(Video lecture links, online articles and blogs).
- [x] My notes on almost all important topics.
- [x] Research papers and my review notes.

Please contribute if you think you have more sources or notes to share :)
