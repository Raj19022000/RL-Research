# Bellman equations and solving MDPs
Markov Decision Processes bring in the sequential decision making and delayed reward aspects of RL.

1. [Professor Balaraman Ravindran's RL week 3,4 and 5th only till policy iteration](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106143/)
2. [Sutton and Barton chapter 3 and 4](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf)

You should implement the algorithms once you understand the proofs.   
I have implemented the following :

- [x] Value iteration
- [x] Policy iteration
- [x] Asynchronous value iteration
- [ ] Real time dynamic programming

The MDP which I have used is from the example 3.5 - Gridworld from Sutton and Barton.

These are my notes on these topics.
